# SHATTERCORE v1.0

**SHATTERCORE** is a modular narrative operating system.  
It is designed to deconstruct, generate, and evolve narrative using **interlocking hexagonal modules** and a recursive shard logic.

---

## Core Features

- 10 Modular Core Engines (Structure, Voice, Emotion, etc.)
- 60 Submodules mapped to hexagonal edges
- Connection logic for merging modules into hybrid systems
- Canon and context-sensitive shard architecture
- Visual UI mockups and 3D shard arrays
- Expandable, author-directed design philosophy

---

## Visual System

Modules are displayed as hexes.  
Each side is a function.  
Any two modules can **connect on matching sides**, forming **new sub-functional logic** (e.g. `Plot + Mood → Emotional Arc`).

---

## Project Assets

- `SHATTERCORE_KnowledgeBase_v1.0.md` — system overview
- `shattercore_hex_system.html` — interactive hex module grid
- Fusion tables, 3D shard visuals, canonical link generators

## Next Steps

- Make the hex UI fully interactive (drag-drop, click-expand)
- Build tools like: Shard Link Builder, Voice Filter, Plot-Emotion Mapper
- Version control your own canon and modular story systems

Made with intention. Built for recursion.  
**SHATTERCORE is yours to extend.**
