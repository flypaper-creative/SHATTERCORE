# SHATTERCORE v1.0

**SHATTERCORE** is a modular narrative operating system.  
It is designed to deconstruct, generate, and evolve narrative using **interlocking hexagonal modules** and a recursive shard logic.

---

## Core Features

- 10 Hexagonal Core Modules (Structure, Voice, Emotion, etc.)
- 60 Submodules, each mapped to a hex edge
- Hybrid logic generation through modular side-connection
- Contextual shard-link system for scalable storytelling
- Visual mockups for UI and 3D narrative arrays
- Designed for authorial control and recursive creativity

---

## Visual System

Modules are represented as hexagons.  
Each side is a functional submodule.  
Modules connect on shared edges to form **composite narrative functions** —  
e.g. `Plot + Mood → Emotional Arc`

## Included Assets

- `SHATTERCORE_KnowledgeBase_v1.0.md`: full modular documentation
- `shattercore_hex_system.html`: interactive hex grid mockup
- Fusion logic matrix (submodule merger examples)
- Real shard links and 3D narrative chain visualizations

---

## Use Cases

- Worldbuilding systems
- Interactive fiction engines
- Writer AI interfaces
- Modular screenplay outlines
- Game narrative design

## What's Next

- Make the hex UI interactive (drag, combine, expand)
- Build live tools for linking shards into chains
- Deploy as a narrative toolkit, API, or GPT extension
- Expand into SHATTERCORE v2 with collaborative plugin architecture
